"""Core model components for SciStanPy probabilistic modeling framework.

This submodule contains the fundamental building blocks for constructing
probabilistic models in SciStanPy. It provides a comprehensive set of
components that enable users to define complex probabilistic models through
composition of simple, well-defined elements.
