"""Transformation components for mathematical operations on SciStanPy model parameters.

This submodule provides a comprehensive framework for mathematical transformations
that can be applied to model parameters in SciStanPy. These transformations enable
the construction of complex probabilistic models through composition of simple
mathematical operations while maintaining automatic differentiation capabilities
and Stan code generation.
